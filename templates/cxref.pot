#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"cxref-cpp is a cpp-like program used by cxref for better comment processing "
"and support.  Proper operation of cxref-cpp requires configuration against "
"the gcc and cpp versions you have installed on your system.  These of course "
"may change with each upgrade.  This package can attempt to automatically "
"keep track of your installed gcc and cpp versions and reconfigure cxref-cpp "
"accordingly, or it can leave such configuration up to you.  In the latter "
"case, you can run /usr/bin/cxref-cpp-configure as root whenever you wish, "
"and/or you can edit the file /etc/cxref/cxref-cpp.defines by hand.  In the "
"former case, the defines file will be automatically updated every time the "
"cxref package is reconfigured.  In addition, cxref-cpp will detect any gcc "
"version mismatch at runtime and regenerate a temporary cxref-cpp.defines "
"file on the fly, warning the user of the situation."
