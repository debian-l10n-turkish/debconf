"The t-prot package provides a config file /etc/t-prot/Muttrc -- to use the "
"script from mutt you have to enable it.  You can do this either by creating "
"a symlink in /etc/Muttrc.d/ for systemwide usage (rather, this can be done "
"automatically for you), or let the users decide to add a \"source\" line for "
"it in their ~/.muttrc or ~/.mutt/muttrc.  If you acknowledge this question "
"the systemwide usage will be enabled."
