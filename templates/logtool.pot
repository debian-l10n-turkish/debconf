"Logtool needs a database with regular expressions that describe logfile "
"entries that should be ignored, or considered less important. You can write "
"this database manually, or use the very flexible database in the package "
"logcheck-database for this purpose."

"If you choose to use logcheck-database and already added values to the files "
"in /etc/logtool, these files will be replaced by symbolic links in the "

"not unwanted behaviour."

"The database in the logcheck-database package defines three levels: "
