"The FireWall KNock OPerator daemon has not been set up yet. This install "
"process can configure fwknopd to protect the SSH port with a simple Rijndael "
"shared key, but moving to a GnuPG setup is recommended. Setting up GnuPG for "
"SPA communications involves a few manual steps that are described in the "
"fwknop documentation. In the meantime, using Rijndael for SPA encryption and "
"decryption provides decent security."
