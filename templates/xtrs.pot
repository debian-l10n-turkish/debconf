"The xtrs package will not function as it ships because it requires a ROM "
"image from one of the original TRS-80 Model I, III, 4, or 4P computers to "
"operate.  (In Model 4P mode, only a disk image of a compatible operating "
"system is required.)  Because of licensing restrictions on the ROM images "
"and TRS-80 operating systems, they cannot be distributed with this Debian "
"package.  You will need to obtain this software and install it where xtrs "
"expects to find it for the program to work."
