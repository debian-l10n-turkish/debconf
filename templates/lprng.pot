"For full RFC1179 compliance you need to make these programs setuid root.  "
"This is mainly so they can create a socket with a low port number. The low "
"port number may be important if you have network printers or have adjusted /"
"etc/lprng/lpd.perms to restrict access to non-privledged ports. For the "
"typical printer connected locally to parallel port (and many other) scenario "
"you can leave these programs non setuid root."
