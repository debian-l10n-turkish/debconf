"gpr can install a wrapper in place of the command lpr. The wrapper will call "
"the real lpr command if: either it is called from a terminal, or there is no "
"access to an X DISPLAY; otherwise it will call gpr. This wrapper can be "
"useful when printing from graphical programs (such as mozilla or "
"openoffice), so that the users will be able to choose the printer and other "
"printer-related settings."
