"According to a security audit by Taylor Hornby (Defuse Security), the "
"current implementation of Encfs is vulnerable or potentially vulnerable to "
"multiple types of attacks. For example, an attacker with read/write access "
"to encrypted data might lower the decryption complexity for subsequently "
"encrypted data without this being noticed by a legitimate user, or might use "
"timing analysis to deduce information."
