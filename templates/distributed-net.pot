"The distributed.net client needs to be configured before it can be used. "
"While most options have reasonable defaults, you need to specify the e-mail "
"address to which you would like distributed.net to credit any work done by "
"the client. If you are installing the distributed-net package for the first "
"time, then you must configure the client, otherwise the distributed.net "
"client will refuse to start."

"When the distributed.net client is run as a daemon (via /etc/init.d/"
"distributed-net), the output will be redirected to /var/log/distributed-net."
"log. You do not need to set up a log file. Since the init script is "
"controlling the distributed.net client, you should not enable \"quiet mode\" "
"as that breaks the init script."
