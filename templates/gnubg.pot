"For maximum strength, GNU Backgammon needs a two-sided bearoff database, "
"used to evaluate positions in the end-game.  This database takes up 6.6MB of "
"disk space and requires several minutes to generate on a reasonably fast "
"computer.  GNU Backgammon is fully playable without this database, but will "
"use weaker heuristics for the end of the game."
