"In the included PaX patch a security bug was found. It affects kernels with "
"SEGMEXEC or RANDEXEC enabled (the predefined LOW and MEDIUM options do not "
"contain these). All users are encouraged to upgrade soon as the bug is "
"locally (and maybe remotely) exploitable; if you can not upgrade, then echo "
"\"0 0\" > /proc/sys/vm/pagetable_cache would reduce the risk, but patching "
"is still unavoidable. References: http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-"

"Quoting upstream: \"During the audit, a critical vulnerability was found in "
"the RBAC system that effectively gave every subject the \"O\" flag, allowing "
"a root user for instance to gain the privileges of any other process through "
"LD_PRELOAD or ptrace.\" Also, a number of other bugs were fixed in general, "
"including PaX. Please upgrade to this release as soon as you can."
