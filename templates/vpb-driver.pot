#. Type: string
#. Default
#. Translators, you can find a list of the ITU-T codes here:
#. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes
#. This is the prefix someone would dial to make an international call to a
#. phone in the region you are translating for, without any "long distance call"
#. prefix numbers that are specific to the telephone exchange being called from.
#. Feel free to alter the examples given to other regions if appropriate, but do
#. try to pick regions with numeric codes that are not easily confused with some
#. other numeric series than the ITU-T codes.
