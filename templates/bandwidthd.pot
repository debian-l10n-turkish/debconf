"Bandwidthd needs to know which interface it should listen for traffic on. "
"Only a single interface can be specified. If you want to listen on all "
"interfaces you should specify the metainterface \"any\". Running "
"\"bandwidthd -l\" will list available interfaces."

"Bandwidthd can create graphs for one or several ip-subnets. Subnets are "
"specified either in dotted-quad format (192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0) or in CIDR "
"format (192.168.0.0/16) and separated by a comma. Example: 192.168.0.0/16, "
"10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0, 172.16.1.0/24. If you don't know what to specify then "
"you can use 0.0.0.0/0 but it is strongly discouraged."

"Bandwidthd can log captured traffic information to Common Data File (CDF) "
"logs. These logs are required if you want to keep old information stored "
"between restarts of the bandwidthd daemon. Also see the recovercdf "

#. Type: boolean

msgid ""
"If old data is going to be outputed in the graphs, it needs to be read when "
"BandwidthD is restarted. Parsing the CDF logs can take quite some time on a "
"slow machine so you might want to disable it, but then you'll lose the "
"information in the graphs after a reboot and similar.... Also make sure the "
"output_cdf config option is enabled."

"With this option you can tweak the delay used in the html as \"META REFRESH"
"\" value. The default is 150 seconds (2.5 minutes). To disable automatic "

"If this option is enabled, all interfaces used to capture traffic "
"information will be put in promiscuous mode. This way traffic thats not "
"routed via the machine running bandwidthd might be trackable anyway. "
"Enabling promiscuous mode will probably not be able to capture any more "
"traffic in a normal switched network. Also rootkit detectors might warn "
"about bandwidthd being a virus if using promiscuous mode. You should "
"probably leave this option disabled."

"Each sensor should have an identification string to be able to tell from "
"where the traffic in the PostgreSQL-database was detected on. This option is "
"usually set to the fully qualified hostname of the machine running the "
"bandwidthd sensor. This needs to be a unique string which no other "
"bandwidthd sensor that reports to the same database uses."
