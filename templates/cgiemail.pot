"In old versions of cgiemail, templates that were used for creating e-mails "
"to be sent could be placed anywhere that would be served up by the web "
"server.  This behaviour is a security vulnerability: an attacker can read "
"files that he shouldn't be able to, such as scripts in cgi-bin, if they "
"contain certain pieces of text."

"If you enter nothing (that is, erase the default directory, leaving this "
"empty), cgiemail will still work. This may be needed if you are, for "
"instance, hosting web services, and cannot move all of your clients cgiemail "
"templates to one directory.  Remember that this will LEAVE THE SECURITY HOLE "
"OPEN, and is only a choice for backwards compatibility."
