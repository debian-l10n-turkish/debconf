"In order to work, the Remembrance Agent needs to build a database of "
"documents of interest. Please introduce the directories (and/or files) to be "
"indexed separated by spaces, afterwards the database will be made. If you do "
"not select any directories (default) the database will not be made. For more "

"You can exclude sensitive directories from being indexed by ra-index if you "
"want. Only three directories can be given here. NOTE: If you are installing "
"on a multiuser environment where each user may want to have their personal "
"index, DO NOT index user directories (that is /home) as root since there are "
"no mechanisms to prevent users from invading other's privacy. Instead, all "
"users can run 'ra-index' in order to build their own databases."
