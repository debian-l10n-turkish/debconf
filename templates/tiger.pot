"The user you enter below will receive all the emails that 'tiger' sends "
"during the day when running the cron jobs. This does not mean that when "
"executing the 'tiger' program standalone this user will receive the reports. "
"Also note that any administrator will be able to access the reports since "

"You should customize the files at /etc/tiger/ to adapt to your local "
"security policy. Firstly, customizing the kind of checks that will be made "
"in this system, as well as the information needed for tests in order to "
"reduce false positives (in /etc/tiger/tigerrc). Secondly, customizing at "
"what times these tests will be executed (in /etc/tiger/cronrc). And thirdly, "
"since some modules warnings might not be problems regarding your current "
"security policy, define a given template file at /etc/tiger/templates/ using "
"runs from each of the modules. Once defined, all the runs will be checked "
"against each one of the templates available (one per module) and only new "
"warnings will be issued."
