"This package conflicts with a lot of client service components that depend "

"By default some unnecessary services are enabled on your system. The program "

"The VNC server in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution contains the tightvnc "
"patches which in addition to adding compression make it possible to use ssh "
"tunnelling. You do that from the client by adding the -via switch when "
"connecting. To make sure that no plaintext passwords are transmitted over "
"the network you have to add firewalling rules on the local machine that "
"disallow direct connections to the VNC ports (see the manpage for exact "
"numbers). Only connections from the local interface should be allowed, to "
"make it possible to tunnel it using ssh."
