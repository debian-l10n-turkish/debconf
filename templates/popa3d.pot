"In standalone mode, popa3d will become a daemon, accepting connections on "
"the pop3 port (110/tcp) and forking child processes to handle them. This has "
"lower overhead than starting popa3d from an inetd equivalent and is thus "
"useful on busy servers to reduce load. See popa3d(8) for more details."
