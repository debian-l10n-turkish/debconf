"Normally slay will punish ordinary users trying to run it by slaying "
"themselves. This is The Right Thing(TM), as users should not mess with "
"administrative commands like slay, but some administrators find it "
"inconvenient. Therefore slay can be configured to punish users or just to "
"display error message."

"Slay has two sets of messages: a standard set and an alternative set that is "
"more informal.  The alternative set is named after \"Butt-head\" from MTV's "
"\"Beavis & Butt-head\" cartoon show, a character who uses the sort of "
"language you'll find in the alternative set.  In most cases, the standard "
"set of messages is more appropriate."
