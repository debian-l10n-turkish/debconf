"Please enter the 'mail name' of your system. This is the hostname portion of "

"Some versions of Debian's various trn packages used /etc/news/whoami to "
"construct the default From: line of outgoing mail and news messages. This "

"However, /etc/news/whoami says that addresses on your system are in the "
"domain ${whoami}, while /etc/mailname says that they are in the domain "
"${mailname}. In common with your mail configuration, trn4 will use /etc/"
"mailname from now on anyway; if you need to change this, you might consider "
"setting the FROM environment variable for each user to be that user's e-mail "
"address."
