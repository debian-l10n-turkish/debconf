"Previously, you had to modify /etc/cron.daily/tmpreaper which could be a "
"pain because that got updated regularly, and you'd have to reimplement your "

"the file age, extra --protect patterns, and which directories to reap in /"
"etc/tmpreaper.conf."

"Before, you could set the maximum age for files before they were removed in /"

"booting to clean out /tmp."
