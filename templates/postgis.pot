"Debian is now shipping PostGIS version 2.1 and dropped support for 2.0, "
"meaning bug or security fixes will no longer be provided for the older one. "
"Thus it is strongly recommended to migrate all databases to PostGIS 2.1 as "
"soon as possible."

"Of course, databases that are already using PostGIS 2.0 will continue to "
"work. Note, however, that with this upgrade it's no longer possible to "
"create version 2.0 of the extension PostGIS. Instead, 'CREATE EXTENSION "
"postgis;' will now give you version 2.1. Note that this also affects backups."
