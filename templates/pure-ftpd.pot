"Pure-ftpd can be run from inetd or as a standalone daemon. Using inetd is a "
"suitable option for small ftp servers because the inetd super-server will "
"only launch pure-ftpd to handle incoming connections. Standalone operation "
"is more efficient for busy ftp sites."

"Older versions of the pure-ftpd debian package used command-line options "

msgid ""
"Pure-ftpd now uses the /etc/pure-ftpd.conf file (via pure-config.pl) for "
"configuration in either standalone or inetd mode. You should check that any "
"customization you've made in the /etc/default/pure-ftpd OPTIONS are "
"reflected in /etc/pure-ftpd.conf, as it is not possible for the moment to "
"use a way to do this automatically that would work for all cases. You can "
"then delete the unused OPTIONS line to avoid seeing this message in the "
"future."
