"The Internet Kermit Service Daemon (IKSD) is the C-Kermit program running as "
"an Internet service, similar to an FTP or Telnet server.  It executes Telnet "
"protocol just like a Telnet server and it transfers files like an FTP "
"server.  But unlike an FTP server, IKSD uses the Kermit file transfer "
"protocol (which is more powerful and flexible) and allows both FTP-like "
"client/server connections as well as direct keyboard interaction.  Secure "
"authentication methods and encrypted sessions are available, as well as a "
"wide range of file transfer and management functions, which can be scripted "
"to automate arbitrarily complex tasks."
